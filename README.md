# Netty-Client-AES-CBC

This project is a **Netty-based TCP client** that communicates securely with the [Netty Server AES-CBC](https://github.com/Hatomoyo2721/Netty-Server-AES-CBC).

It demonstrates how to send and receive encrypted messages using **AES-CBC** with optional **RSA key exchange**.

## ⚙️ Features

- Built with **Netty 4.x** (asynchronous and event-driven).
- Uses **AES-CBC** for data encryption and decryption.
- Supports **RSA** for secure key exchange between client and server.
- Simple message sending and receiving pipeline.
- Easy to extend for authentication or logging.
